        LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Britain announced a new package of sanctions against Belarus on Friday, saying four individuals and three entities had been targeted over human rights violations and the ongoing facilitation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The British government said the coordinated action with international partners marked the fourth anniversary of the "deeply flawed" 2020 presidential elections in Belarus.Most independent observers believe President Alexander Lukashenko lost that election. He hung on to power by imprisoning thousands to crush months of street protests with the help of his ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin.
